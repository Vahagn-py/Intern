The goal of the task is to get a randomly generated 2D NFT collection images with the given assets.

You are given folders of images and count list json file.
The images in each folder are the PNG assets for the layer with the same name as the folder.
The `counts.json` file includes all the counts for all the layer images, on how many times each image should be used/met in the collection.

The goal is to generate and render 200 NFT images where each NFT should have some layer image from each layer.
Render final images using alhpa blending (all the images have transparency).
The order of rendering/blending of the layers is important. Keep the order as given in the example below.

Example:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Background     - Lavendar        (1 of 35 in the whole collection)
Skin           - Peachy          (1 of 70 in the whole collection)
Clothes        - Filipina Gown   (1 of 11 in the whole collection)
Chain          - No Chain        (1 of 55 in the whole collection)
Eyes           - Lighting Laser  (1 of 40 in the whole collection)
Hats and Hair  - Moon Halo       (1 of  5 in the whole collection)
Earring        - Diamond         (1 of 20 in the whole collection)
Nose and mouth - Lip Curl        (1 of 35 in the whole collection)

You are free to use any programming languages and libraries.

Expected result:
200 images with correct layer image counts.

Bonus point:
Try to include the asset names in the rendered image names.
